This extension is designed to help you learn new words in **Japanese**, **English**, and **Spanish**.  
Just type a word to see its definition.

- If you already know the word, click **"Too Easy"** to add it to your known list.
- If the word is new and you want to practice it, click **"Set Reminder"**.  The extension will show you the word again randomly to help reinforce your memory.
- For every 10 words you learn, you'll earn a star. Keep learning to unlock more stars!
